# ðŸŽ² The Pig Game Project â€” Collaborative JavaScript Game

Welcome to one of our early but exciting JavaScript-based browser games: **The Pig Game**!

---

## ðŸ‘¥ Team & Collaboration

This project was developed by **FÄ±rat Atalay** and **AyÅŸe MandÄ±ralÄ±** as part of our hands-on learning journey in frontend development.  
While building this game together, we explored DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and most importantly, how to think like real developers â€” solving problems with logic and efficiency.

## ðŸŽ® Project Description

**The Pig Game** is a simple yet engaging dice game built entirely with **vanilla JavaScript** and DOM APIs. The rules are straightforward:

- Two players take turns to roll the dice.
- Rolling a "1" resets the current score and passes the turn.
- Players can "hold" their score to add it to their total.
- The first to reach a target score wins!

Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in:

- Handling events and UI updates in real-time
- Structuring JavaScript code into logical components
- Collaborating on features and fixing bugs together
- Enhancing UI with conditional rendering and transitions

## ðŸ§  What We Learned

- Practical understanding of the DOM and event listeners
- Core JavaScript concepts like functions, scope, conditionals, and game logic
- Team communication, task-sharing, and collaborative debugging
- Thinking algorithmically and simplifying logic without overcomplicating

## ðŸ™Œ Final Thoughts

This was one of the first projects where we applied what we learned and made something fun and functional together.  
We believe learning is best when shared â€” and this project helped us grow both technically and as a team.
